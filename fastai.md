# How did I start doing AI

I was always fascinated by the hype over the AI/ML that I used to hear during my 1st year and half of the second year. 

Even I wanted to start doing AI/ML but I took suggestions from my seniors that it's better to start doing it in the 3rd year as I will get to explore more fields by then.

So during this COVID-19 lockdown period after submitting my GSoC proposal I thought of starting a course in ML/AI.

At first, I didn't know what even is the difference b/w AI/Ml and what we can actually use it for.

### What is AI, and my point of view towards it.

AI( Artificial Intelligence) is a self-explanatory word, which means making some objects to behave in the way as human behaviour.

There used to be people roaming in the forests to get an insight about poachers who came for hunting, but now this job can be done, by using a machine that constantly monitors the people for some radius around it, knowing the difference between the people who came near the trees and animal for taking care or for killing.

This is a basic example of what and how AI is used.

### What is Machine Learning, Deep learning etc.

These are the subfields in AI, which specialize in solving specific kinds of problems.


## How did I start.
I have seen many courses for AI but these two are the best in my opinion

- Andrew Ng Machine Learning course from Coursera.
  - This is a course thought by one of the great people in the AI community.
  - This teaches the course in a bottom-up approach, which means they teach you the basics first and then goes to the project.  
  - This is a bit old course but the basic and everything is great.
- Fast.ai course 
  - this is a separate online course, there is no registration for it.
  - Teaches in a top-down approach, teach us how the models etc works and then tell us the basics behind it.
  - This is a newer course.

I have started the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course in which the first part is [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/)

I will be saying briefly about the lesson1 and two that I learned in my next post.
