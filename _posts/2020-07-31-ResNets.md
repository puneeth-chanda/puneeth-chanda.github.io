## What are ResNets

So let us start by the diiference between a normal(plain) network and a Residual(ResNet) network.

this is a plain network
![*part*](/assets/images/plain.png)

and this is a residual network
![resnet](/assets/images/resnet.png)

so the difference between these two is in the first layer

**Plain**: The starting activation *a[l]* is passed through a layer and the resulting through another and so on and the output partition we get is *a[l+2]* which is generated only using the activation *a[l+1]*

**ResNet**: The activation *a[l]* is passed to the last RelU activation skipping the middle later this is to ensure that failure of training a deeper neural network is reduced
