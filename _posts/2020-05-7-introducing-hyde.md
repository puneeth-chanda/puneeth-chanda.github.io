title: Introducing Me

Good _____________ ,

Fill the blank yourself as I don’t know at which point of the day you are opening this blog…..

A good start isn’t it, basically I am this kind of a person who wants uniqueness in every thing. and the “I” guy i am referring here is called by  name “Puneeth”.

I have no particular  goals at this point of time but I know that I would set a goal someday and currently hoping that the day will come soon…

And coming to my interest, my only constant interest is FOOD basically I am a foodie and for me eating different kinds of dishes is a hobbie and almost I had visited almost all the restaurants, food parks etc.. in my town and don’t think I like only eating  I like cooking too……

The principle that I follow in my life is

<div class="message" style="color: brown">
  Be Positive
</div>

And since I am an AMRITIAN

Namah shivaya.. and signing off. :P
